# MODULE 1 QUIZ

#### 1. Which of the following are true when it comes to the business value of big data? (Select all that apply.)
  * The size of the data businesses collect is growing. As the technology improves, businesses are collecting more and more data
  * Businesses are increasingly making data-driven decisions


#### 2. Spark uses... (Select all that apply.)
  * A driver node to distribute work across a number of executor nodes
  * A distributed cluster of networked computers made of a driver node and many executor nodes


#### 3. How does Spark execute code backed by DataFrames? (Select all that apply.)
  * It optimizes your query by figuring out the best "how" to execute what you want
  * It separates the "logical plan" of what you want to accomplish from the "physical plan" of how to do it so it can optimize the query


#### 4. What are the properties of Spark DataFrames? (Select all that apply.)
  * Distributed: Computed across multiple nodes. Each node computes on its own data
  * Dataset: Collection of partitioned data. The collection of data is partitioned so it can be distributed across the cluster
  * Resilent: Fault-tolerant. If you lose a worker, only recompute work that worker was responsible for


#### 5. What is the difference between Spark and database technologies? (Select all that apply.)
  * Spark is a computation engine and is not for data storage
  * Spark is a highly optimized compute engine and is not a database
  * Spark is a robust unified analytics engine and does not act like a database


#### 6. What is Amdahl's law of scalability? (Select all that apply.)
  * Amdahl's law states that the speedup of a task is a function of how much of that task can be parallelized
  * A formula that gives the theoretical speedup as a function of the percentage of a computation that can be parallelized


#### 7. Spark offers a unified approach to analytics. What does this include? (Select all that apply.)
  * Spark provides a common framework for data analysts, data scientists, and data engineers to all use the same technology and design patterns.
  * Spark code can be written in the following languages: SQL, Scala, Java, Python and R
  * Spark unifies applications such as SQL queries, streaming and Machine Learning
  * Spark is able to connect data where it lives in any number of sources, unifying the components of data application


#### 8. What is a Databricks notebook?
    
    
    R = A collaborative, interactive workspace that allows you to execute Spark queries at scale.


#### 9. How can you get data into Databricks? (Select all that apply.)
  * By registering the data as a table
  * By *"mounting"* data backed by cloud storage
  * By uploading it through the user interface


#### 10. What are the qualities of big data? (Select all that apply.)
  * Velocity: the speed of data
  * Volume: the amount of data
  * Veracity: the reliability of data
  * Variety: the diversity of data
