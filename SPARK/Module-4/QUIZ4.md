# MODULE 4 QUIZ

#### 1. Machine learning is suited to solve which of the following tasks? (Select all that apply.)
  * Fraud Detection
  * Finalcial Forecasting
  * Churn Analysis
  * Image Recognition
  * A/B Testing
  * Natural Language Processing
  
#### 2. Is a model that is 99% accurate at predicting breast cancer a good model?
R = Likely no because there are not many cases of cancer in a general population. There are many ways of quantifying the success of a classification task. Accuracy (which is technically the true positive and true negative rates over the total observations) might not capture false negatives.
  
#### 3. What is an appropriate baseline model to compare a machine learning solution to?
R = The average of the dataset
  
#### 4. What is Machine Learning? (Select all that apply.)
  * Learning patterns in your data without being explicitly programmed
  * A function that maps features to an output
  
#### 5. (Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)
##### Predicting whether a website user is fraudulent or not is an example of _________ machine learning. It is a __________ task.

R = supervised, classification


In this case, whether the user is fraudulent is the dependent variable and we are classifying fraudulent from non-fraudulent users.

#### 6. (Fill in the blanks with the appropriate answer below.)
##### Grouping similar users together based on past activity is an example of _________ machine learning. It is a _________ task.
R = unsupervised, clustering

In this case, there is no clear dependent variable so it is an unsupervised problem involving clustering users.

#### 7. Predicting the next quarter of a company's earnings is an example of...
R = Regression. The value we're predicting is a continuous, theoretically unbounded value.
  
#### 8. Why do we want to perform a train/test split before we train a machine learning model? (Select all that apply.)
  * To keep the model from "overfitting" where it memorizes the data it has seen
  * To evaluate how our model performs on unseen data

#### 9. What is a linear regression model learning about your data?
R = The formula for the line of best fit. Linear regression learns the coefficients (or formula) of best line through the data.
  
#### 10. How do you define a custom function not already part of core Spark?
R = With a User-Defined Function. A User-Defined Function (or UDF) allows you to extend core Spark.
