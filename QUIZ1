# MODULE 1 QUIZ

1.Question 1
Based on the dataset for this course, what does this query count?


```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*)
FROM
  dsv1069.users
JOIN
  dsv1069.orders
ON
  users.id = orders.user_id
```
R = Counts the number of rows in the orders table.
All of the orders have a user_id, and every user is in the user's table, so this will return the one row for every entry in the orders table.


2. Assume you have no information about the data in the example table.
When I run the query below, no rows are returned, but there are no error messages. What are possible reasons for this? (Select all that apply.)

```sql
SELECT *
FROM example_table
WHERE id IS NULL
```

R =
* There are no rows in the example_table - it's empty
* There are no rows with null id


3. In the events table, (dsv1069.events) for this class, how many rows exist per event_id?
R = One per parameter name


4. When you encounter a new dataset, which of the following can you assume? (Select all that apply.)
R =
* Test usage is unfiltered
* The table is empty
* There are duplicated rows
* The data is out-of-date


5. TROUBLESHOOT THIS ERROR:
Based on your exploration of the tables in the course dataset. Why are the results to this specific query empty?

```sql
SELECT *
FROM
  dsv1069.users
JOIN
  dsv1069.events
ON
  users.parent_user_id = events.user_id
WHERE
  event_name = 'view_item'
AND
  merged_at IS NULL
```
NO ROWS RETURNED
